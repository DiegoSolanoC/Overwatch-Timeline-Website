# 🚀 GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## Quick Overview
Your site will be live at: `https://your-username.github.io/Timeline-Overwatch`

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Method 1: Upload via GitHub Website (EASIEST)

#### Step 1: Create a New Repository
1. Go to https://github.com and log in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right corner
3. Click **"New repository"**

#### Step 2: Configure Repository
- **Repository name**: `Timeline-Overwatch` (or any name you want)
- **Description**: "My interactive website" (optional)
- **Public**: Make sure it's set to Public (required for free GitHub Pages)
- **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)
- Click **"Create repository"**

#### Step 3: Upload Your Files
After creating the repository, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Look for:
**"...or push an existing repository from the command line"**

But we'll use the easier web upload method:
1. Look for the link that says **"uploading an existing file"** (it's in the middle of the page)
2. Click it
3. **Drag and drop** ALL these files and folders from your project:
   
   **Essential Files:**
   - index.html (redirects to main.html)
   - main.html (main entry point for GitHub Pages)
   - styles.css
   - script.js
   - test-loader.js
   - README.md
   - .gitignore
   - manifest.json
   
   **Important:** Do NOT upload `map.html` or `test.html` - these are for local development only!
   
   **Required Folders:**
   - data/ (events.json, locations.json, etc.)
   - controllers/
   - models/
   - views/
   - utils/
   - js/
   - helpers/
   - Event Images/
   - Heroes/
   - Factions/
   - Music/
   - Music Icons/
   - Sound Effects/
   - Main Menu Buttons/
   
   **Required Assets:**
   - All .png icon files (Palette Icon.png, Music Icon.png, etc.)
   - All .glb 3D model files
   - loading.gif
   - Home Button.png
   - MAP.png, MAP Black.png, etc.
4. In the "Commit changes" box at the bottom, type: `Initial commit - website files`
5. Click **"Commit changes"**

#### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1. In your repository, click the **"Settings"** tab (top right area)
2. In the left sidebar, click **"Pages"** (under "Code and automation")
3. Under **"Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
4. Under **"Branch"**, select **"main"** (or "master" if that's what shows)
5. Keep the folder as **"/ (root)"**
6. Click **"Save"**

#### Step 5: Wait and Access Your Site
1. After clicking Save, you'll see a blue box that says "GitHub Pages source saved"
2. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for GitHub to build your site
3. Refresh the Settings → Pages page
4. You'll see a green box with: **"Your site is live at https://your-username.github.io/Timeline-Overwatch"**
5. Click the link to see your live website! 🎉

4. Make it Public
5. Click "Create repository"

#### Step 2: Push Your Code

# Initialize git (if not already done)

# Add all files

## 🌐 Custom Domain (Optional)

Want your own domain like `mysite.com` instead of `username.github.io`?

1. Buy a domain from: Namecheap, Google Domains, or Cloudflare (~$10-15/year)
2. In your repository: Settings → Pages → Custom domain
3. Enter your domain and click Save
4. In your domain registrar, add a CNAME record pointing to `your-username.github.io`

GitHub Pages is free even with a custom domain!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Pages option in Settings"
- Make sure your repository is **Public**, not Private
- Make sure you've uploaded at least one file

### "My site shows a 404 error"
- Make sure `main.html` is uploaded (this is the main entry point)
- Make sure `index.html` is uploaded (it redirects to main.html)
- Wait a full 5 minutes, sometimes it takes time
- Try accessing: `https://your-username.github.io/Timeline-Overwatch/main.html` directly
- Try accessing: `https://your-username.github.io/Timeline-Overwatch/index.html` (should redirect)

### "CSS/JavaScript isn't working"
- Make sure all files are in the same folder (root of repository)
- Check that file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5)

### "I want to change the URL"
- You can rename your repository in Settings → General → Repository name
- Your URL will automatically update to the new name
