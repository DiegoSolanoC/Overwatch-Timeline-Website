And he engineered alongside his college deparment in the Great Basin Desert, a home printable water extractor, which combined with Namuaca's technology, allowed peopleto get clearn water essentially out of tin air, extracted from any degree of humidity.\n\nThe work of these  two men forever changed the world as we knew it, and would eventually be the key to take humanity to the stars and Beyond",

Scientists all over the globe scrambled for ideas to produce cost effective clean energy that could become a world wide standard. \n\nDr. Justina Borda was one of the first to tackle this issue. A phycologist specialized on genetics, who saught to improve energy equity on her home of Colombia. Borda developed a strain of algae capable of thriving in low oxygen waters, and photosynthesizing at disproportional speeds. and after many attempts, she was able to get the energy produced by the algae to work alongside a Goldilocks Generator, taking the excess of electricity fromthe algae and essentially transforming any body of water into a sola panel.\n\nBorda's invention spread across the world rapidly, as rural communities quickly standarized its used, to the point that even the most remote corners of the world have bodies of water where here creation managed to propagate. As her invention became the norm, the public moved away from fossil fuels for their daily energy conssumption.\n\nBorda kickstarted a green energy revolution, and as superstorms became all the more common, the wind energy industry followed, which ultimately lead to a decrease in carbon emissions of  more than 20 percent during this period, giving Humanity hope for a better tomorrow",

The time in the hospital gave Vivian a lot of time to read books and play strategy games, as she quickly grew interest in the military like her parents.\n\nAs her condition worsen and threatened her life, her family made the hard choice of admitting her into Dr. Esat's experimental program, where they would replace a vast majority of her body with cybernetics over the years.
