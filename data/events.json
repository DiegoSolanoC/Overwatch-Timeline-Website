Scientists all over the globe scrambled for ideas to produce cost effective clean energy that could become a world wide standard. \n\nDr. Justina Borda was one of the first to tackle this issue. A phycologist specialized on genetics, who saught to improve energy equity on her home of Colombia. Borda developed a strain of algae capable of thriving in low oxygen waters, and photosynthesizing at disproportional speeds. and after many attempts, she was able to get the energy produced by the algae to work alongside a Goldilocks Generator, taking the excess of electricity fromthe algae and essentially transforming any body of water into a sola panel.\n\nBorda's invention spread across the world rapidly, as rural communities quickly standarized its used, to the point that even the most remote corners of the world have bodies of water where here creation managed to propagate. As her invention became the norm, the public moved away from fossil fuels for their daily energy conssumption.\n\nBorda kickstarted a green energy revolution, and as superstorms became all the more common, the wind energy industry followed, which ultimately lead to a decrease in carbon emissions of  more than 20 percent during this period, giving Humanity hope for a better tomorrow",

The pair were known for their inventions and together they used their resources to propose to the Portuguese Government to begin the construciton of a giant sea wall.\n\nThe Wall was to be made out of Durovidro, a synthetic material Cláudio himself had invented years earlier. Not only was it nearly as tough as a diamond, but it also had the unique quality of neutralizing acidicy, which made it perfect to both solve the rising tides eroding the coast, and preserving the ecosystems around the area.

With the years of acumulated knowledge, they founded what later became the University, where traditional wisdom was to pioneer new science, for students to have all the knowledge of the past, available to guide their future.\n\nThe University, true to its name, splits its fields of study into five categories, relating to the phases of the Wuxing teachings. \nThe Fire College, for the study of martial arts and defensive strategies.\nThe Metal College, for robotics and technological engineering.\nThe Water College, for traditional medicine and applications into new medical advancements.\nThe Earth College, for agricultural and substainability studies.\nAnd Wood College, for civil and enviromental engineering.\nEach of these faculties played mayor roles into China's major advancements during the following decades, quickly increasing the College's prestige across the world.",

As humanity risked famine across the board, GMOS seemed like the obvious solution, specially after the sucess of Borda's Algae and Taupega's Coral, which heavily reshaped public Opinion on artificially enhanced life. \n\nAs the first set of genetically modified crops began to solve the farming problem, it was precisely their mass appeal that caused harsher regulations to their use, for both safety and privatization reasons. Megacorporations leading this push for artificial crops kept a tight leash on their licensing, leading to multiple lawsuits and price fixing, as farmers couldn't compete with the improved crops, and yet also couldn't afford the seeds themselves.\nThis whole ordeal came to a stop in court, when Matthew Frank, a Manhattan Lawyer, convinced the Supreme Court that bioengineered seeds couldn't be held under a patent or copyright, because they were transformative works of an indigenous species. It also helped to his case that during the pandemics and outbreaks of the previous decades, the rush to get vaccines ready lead to a lot of patents getting dismissed for the sake of saving lives.\n\nThanks to this historic legal victory, the GMO crops became effectively open sourced, and with it effectively solving world hunger. The rise of  this highly effective crops lead to corporate farmers, who would partner with Omnica Corporation to use a robotic workforce, leading to more efficient, but larger Megafarms that quickly encomposed most of the world's arable lands",

The project had taken years and many of those in his discipline moved on, but Bhatt persisted until he finally got a working prototype. His Photon Projectors were capable of altering photon reactivity, coaxing them into binding, creating crystaline structurues, capable of bonding with carbon, forming a durable physical object made out of carbon fibers, this would be known to the world as Hardlight.\n\nThe project was slow but promising, and thanks to the United Nations Global Recovery Program, he would get the grants needed to kickstar Vishkar, and lead his team in researching ways to use this technology in infrastructure. Bhatt envisioned a future where Hardlight would solve housing shortages, transporation issues and material inequity, he always wished for this technology to remain accessible for the public, as a gift to the world.\n\nUnfortunately, a tragic car accident would end his life, and the company would move on without him, away from his altruistic phylosophy. Exactly one year after Bhatt's death, Vishkar made its first public offerings.",
