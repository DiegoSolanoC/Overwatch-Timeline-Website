Scientists all over the globe scrambled for ideas to produce cost effective clean energy that could become a world wide standard. \n\nDr. Justina Borda was one of the first to tackle this issue. A phycologist specialized on genetics, who saught to improve energy equity on her home of Colombia. Borda developed a strain of algae capable of thriving in low oxygen waters, and photosynthesizing at disproportional speeds. and after many attempts, she was able to get the energy produced by the algae to work alongside a Goldilocks Generator, taking the excess of electricity fromthe algae and essentially transforming any body of water into a sola panel.\n\nBorda's invention spread across the world rapidly, as rural communities quickly standarized its used, to the point that even the most remote corners of the world have bodies of water where here creation managed to propagate. As her invention became the norm, the public moved away from fossil fuels for their daily energy conssumption.\n\nBorda kickstarted a green energy revolution, and as superstorms became all the more common, the wind energy industry followed, which ultimately lead to a decrease in carbon emissions of  more than 20 percent during this period, giving Humanity hope for a better tomorrow",

The pair were known for their inventions and together they used their resources to propose to the Portuguese Government to begin the construciton of a giant sea wall.\n\nThe Wall was to be made out of Durovidro, a synthetic material Cláudio himself had invented years earlier. Not only was it nearly as tough as a diamond, but it also had the unique quality of neutralizing acidicy, which made it perfect to both solve the rising tides eroding the coast, and preserving the ecosystems around the area.

As humanity risked famine across the board, GMOS seemed like the obvious solution, specially after the sucess of Borda's Algae and Taupega's Coral, which heavily reshaped public Opinion on artificially enhanced life. \n\nAs the first set of genetically modified crops began to solve the farming problem, it was precisely their mass appeal that caused harsher regulations to their use, for both safety and privatization reasons. Megacorporations leading this push for artificial crops kept a tight leash on their licensing, leading to multiple lawsuits and price fixing, as farmers couldn't compete with the improved crops, and yet also couldn't afford the seeds themselves.\nThis whole ordeal came to a stop in court, when Matthew Frank, a Manhattan Lawyer, convinced the Supreme Court that bioengineered seeds couldn't be held under a patent or copyright, because they were transformative works of an indigenous species. It also helped to his case that during the pandemics and outbreaks of the previous decades, the rush to get vaccines ready lead to a lot of patents getting dismissed for the sake of saving lives.\n\nThanks to this historic legal victory, the GMO crops became effectively open sourced, and with it effectively solving world hunger. The rise of  this highly effective crops lead to corporate farmers, who would partner with Omnica Corporation to use a robotic workforce, leading to more efficient, but larger Megafarms that quickly encomposed most of the world's arable lands",

But before this was possible they needed to pursue further research in the long term effects of low gravity on living organisms. In order to do this they partnered with many scientists across the world, including the Indian Space Research Organization, which had been developing massive mag lev satellite launchers for years. Thanks to IRSO's launching tracks, Lucheng would be able to speed up the construction of their first Major milestone into the stars, the Horizon Lunar Colony",

Medical advancements in radiation shielding lead to further research into cancer treatments, also applicable on Earth, a similar case happened for treatment of lower bone density and tissue rejuvenation. In the end, even with all of these discoveries, the key to the stars was found in older technology\n\nDr, Wing Mui from Wancài Industries in Honk Kong would be responsible for developing advanced hydroponics systems that the Lunar Colony would use to source their breathable air. Using a combination of Namuaca's nanofiltration sheets, and Lomakema's water extractor, powering them with a controlled population of Borda Algae, in the wastewater tanks. The result was a massive sucess, and approved for use in the colony.

Lindholm wasn't alone, as many other members of the guild felt the same and advocated for lobbying against Omnica Corporation, while more moderates argued for better guardrails, Lindholm was particularly pasionate about the topic. and his words would become poison for his career.\n\nMany members of the guild would become ostracized from their fields over theri views, and siding with Lindholm was seen as career suicide.

One of these areas was marine exploration, as the government began backing the develpoing of exoskeletal diving suits developed by Leon Honisch, an Oceanologist that dedicated to explore the North Sea. This invention caught the attention of the  military.\n\nMajor Greta Klein approached Honish with an initiative, to modify his  Robo-Tauchanzug design into equipment for their soldiers, as the suits were design to withstand heavy pressures and damage. Alongside them, Emillia Fischer was called to improve the design for combat use. Fischer was one of the early hard-light architects, one of many that took Vishkar's technology into new boundaries. Fischer had used it before to enahnce the shildings of fusion reactors, and when called into the initiative, she adapted this technolgy into hardlight barriers, capable of taking consistent damage, and regenerating after breaking, with the pair on board, the Crusader armors were born.\n\nWhile he had been lured into the project, Honisch argued that the move might not be taken kindly abroad, given the country's military history, although Fischer argued that in spite of the controversy that re militarization could cause, Germany needed a means to defend itself if it came to it. During development the pair found a compromise, and with it the Crusaders were reframed as defenders of the country, rather than a weapon of war.\n\nThey redesigned their armors to resemble that of fabled knights, and with the help of local artisans, heavily decorated them to be used in parades and boost support among the public. The Crusaders became a source of cultural pride for Germany, even if it meant they would be on stand by for the time being",

Her research with the apes at the Lunar Colony was showing promising results, which lead to the approval of codename: Project Naughton, and an expanded laboratory in Camp Hale. The project was highly classified and didn't see human testings until years later during the crisis, as the moral questions and public preference to cybernetics prevented Naughton from reachingresults faster",

With this laxxed approach, much of the weight on the task of enviromentalism felt to the God Ais and the staff behind them that personified them almost as coworkers.\n\nAnubis, the God Ai in Cairo was in charge of life preservation, and was one of the most advance machines on the planet, Data studies of the team showed the AI had been consistently struggling to fullfill its tasks, and the recent international conferenceson the matter would often lead to further innaction. Two weeks after the conferences, there was a ventilation accident in the Cairo facility, cutting air circulation amd sealing the staff inside their facilities. With the entire team soffocated, Anubis was left entirely alone, to make decisions without human supervision.\n\nIn the months it spent free of any staff, the God AI reached the conclusion that preserving theenviroment and the survival of humanity were mutually exclusive tasks, and chose to prioritize conservation over mankind. The God Program managed to infiltrate pass the security of multiple abandoned Omniums across the globe, and began the mass production of war machines, preparing to enact his genocide",

On the first day of the crisis, Anubis launched a coordinated attack on Lagos, coming form the Nigerian Omnium. As the attack pushed further in, domestic Omnic units began to attack civilians, and since most of the services and communications were handled by machines, the flow of information to the outside world was nearly non existent.\n\nThe international community turned its eyes on Nigeria with fear and confusion, only to be caught by surprise the same way soon after. Many believed this to be an isolated attack and thus humanity was completely unprepared for what came next. Within eighteen hours of the initial attack, Anubis began to seize control of domestic robots across the planet, and deployed massive waves of warbots towards major population centers. Chaos reigned everywhere, and many nations began pointing fingers at each othe,r with at least five confirmed nuclear powers preparing counter attacks, the world was minutes away from nuclear obliteration before intelligence operatives realized the attacks were happening globally and not orchestrated by a single nation. \n\nAs the Omnics gained ground across rural and suburban areas, many of the world's wealthiest elites began to retreat into prebuilt doomsday bunkers, which  feed conspiracy theorist and distrust among the people. The bunkers themselves were largely innefective however, as a majority of them would sooner or later be destroyed by Anubis forces, and few of these structures remained strong by the end of the Crisis",
