Scientists all over the globe scrambled for ideas to produce cost-effective clean energy that could become a worldwide standard.\n\nDr. Justina Borda was one of the first to tackle this issue. A phycologist specialized in genetics, who sought to improve energy equity in her home of Colombia. Borda developed a strain of algae capable of thriving in low oxygen waters and photosynthesizing at disproportionate speeds. And after many attempts, she was able to get the energy produced by the algae to work alongside a Goldilocks Generator, taking the excess of electricity from the algae and essentially transforming any body of water into a sola panel.\n\nBorda's invention spread across the world rapidly, as rural communities quickly standardized its use, to the point that even the most remote corners of the world have bodies of water where their creation managed to propagate. As her invention became the norm, the public moved away from fossil fuels for their daily energy consumption.\n\nBorda kickstarted a green energy revolution, and as superstorms became all the more common, the wind energy industry followed, which ultimately led to a decrease in carbon emissions of more than 20 percent during this period, giving humanity hope for a better tomorrow.",

For years, the people of the Polynesian region requested the international community to take the issue more seriously, but the handling of the situation left a lot to be desired.\n\nThis eventually led to the creation of the Polynesian League, an intergovernmental alliance between New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Samoa and the recently independent Hawaii, where together they would find solutions to the issues affecting their region.",

Once introduced, it quickly helped revitalize the coral reefs of the Pacific and, thanks to its unique metabolism, it helped clean the oceans from chemicals and microplastics. The trade-off was that as the Coral consumed any substances in its path, it grew so large it created massive island-like structures above water. While the view is unlike any other place on earth and one of deep ecological and touristic importance, the expanding size of the reefs also leads to the blocking of many trade routes, causing international inconvenience and scandal.",

Not only was it nearly as tough as a diamond, but it also had the unique quality of neutralizing acidicy, which made it perfect for both solving the rising tides eroding the coast, and preserving the ecosystems around the area.

This technology was so strong that it was capable of giving power to nearly everything around the city of Runasapi and the surrounding areas. The group grew in numbers and research expanded into multiple other fields, eventually leading into cybernetics, where they found a way to engrave solar threads into human bodies, allowing people to directly harness the power of the sun onto themselves, and channel them into different tools. The few selected for this procedure would become the first of the mythical Inti Warriors, the protectors of the city, their technology and their new-found way of life in the isolated mountains of Peru.",

Omnics started to appear everywhere, going from more crude, voiceless models first only affordable by the upper class, to fully personable voiced iterations, mass produced for people all over the world.\n\nAs the company grew, and their Omnics became more and more common, they started to commission their Omniums, massive fully automated factories designed to pump out units continuously. Many cities were more than happy to welcome the company, as they wanted to have the latest in Omnic technology available first.

As humanity risked famine across the board, GMOS seemed like the obvious solution, especially after the success of Borda's Algae and Taupega's Coral, which heavily reshaped public opinion on artificially enhanced life.\n\nAs the first set of genetically modified crops began to solve the farming problem, it was precisely their mass appeal that caused harsher regulations on their use, for both safety and privatization reasons. Megacorporations leading this push for artificial crops kept a tight leash on their licensing, leading to multiple lawsuits and price fixing, as farmers couldn't compete with the improved crops, and yet also couldn't afford the seeds themselves.\nThis whole ordeal came to a stop in court, when Matthew Frank, a Manhattan lawyer, convinced the Supreme Court that bioengineered seeds couldn't be held under a patent or copyright, because they were transformative works of an indigenous species. It also helped to his case that, during the pandemics and outbreaks of the previous decades, the rush to get vaccines ready lead to a lot of patents getting dismissed for the sake of saving lives.\n\nThanks to this historic legal victory, the GMO crops became effectively open sourced, and with it, effectively solving world hunger. The rise of these highly effective crops led to corporate farmers, who would partner with Omnica Corporation to use a robotic workforce, leading to more efficient, but larger megafarms that quickly encompassed most of the world's arable lands.",

Macaria from Brigeport, Connecticut, in charge of communication systems across the States, and the most infamous of them all, Anubis from Cairo, Egypt, made to pursue ecological solutions for the preservation of life.\n\nOn a smaller scale, less complex AIs were also established to control local traffic, stocking stores, and manage public work projects, among other things, while on a global level, the God Programs handled these resources and many more with an international perspective in mind, ensuring equity, efficiency and progress.\n\nWhile their power allowed humanity to take a back seat as the world moved forward, many skeptics worried that these God programs were given too much power, and had too much leeway to make decisions, and to calm these fears.

But before this was possible, they needed to pursue further research into the long-term effects of low gravity on living organisms. In order to do this, they partnered with many scientists across the world, including the Indian Space Research Organization, which had been developing massive mag lev satellite launchers for years.

Medical advancements in radiation shielding lead to further research into cancer treatments, also applicable on Earth. A similar case happened for treatment of lower bone density and tissue rejuvenation. In the end, even with all of these discoveries, the key to the stars was found in older technology.\n\nDr. Wing Mui from Wancài Industries in Honk Kong would be responsible for developing advanced hydroponics systems that the Lunar Colony would use to source their breathable air. Using a combination of Namuaca's nano-filtration sheets and Lomakema's water extractor, powering them with a controlled population of Borda Algae, in the wastewater tanks. The result was a massive success, and approved for use in the colony.

Lindholm wasn't alone, as many other members of the guild felt the same and advocated for lobbying against Omnica Corporation, while more moderates argued for better guardrails, Lindholm was particularly passionate about the topic, and his words would become poison for his career.\n\nMany members of the guild would become ostracized from their fields over their views, and siding with Lindholm was seen as career suicide. Torbjörn would return home, to dedicate himself to raising his family with his now wife, Ingrid. As the world moved forward into developing Omnics, away from his warnings.",

Between the heavy criticism of the Ironclad guild, the massive spending and broken promises that came with many Omniums, and to top it off, they had reached a point of near perfection with their Omnic designs, where their models would barely every break down and most of the public were willing to buy an Omnic already owned them. The company was in need of a big idea, one that could save them from collapse, and the answer to their troubles seemed to be Mina Liao.\n\n\nDr. Mina Liao was a prodigy and pioneer of neuroplastic artificial intelligence that had built continuous innovations in the field. She was selected by Omnica to develop the most advanced AI the world had ever seen. Liao's work was both revolutionary and controversial, as many feared this was pushing boundaries too far, but in the end she would reveal Omnica's crowning achievement, with the birth of Aurora.\n\nLiao argued that their newest Omnic was fully sentient, and capable of human-level cognition. While there were many skeptics, the robot passed every test they could think of. Confident in their discovery and understanding the moral issues associated with monetizing it, Liao took it upon herself to not just prove her sentiment, but to pursue personhood.\n\nAfter a long legal battle and international controversy, an international court would declare Aurora as sentient, and grant her full civil rights. Liao helped to cement Omnica's dominance as the unstoppable leader in robotic innovation, but in doing so, she brought even more negative press and expenses for the company, ultimately being the cause of their downfall.",

The base became the home of a colony of primates and other animals, to use for the study of long-term effects of low gravity, hoping this would prepare humanity for future trips into the stars.\n\nThe Apes underwent many genetic treatments that would increase their size, and alongside it their strength and intelligence, and a group of scientists in the base dedicated themselves to observing and teaching the primates to solve complex problems far beyond the capabilities of their counterparts back on Earth.\n\nIn its heyday, many prominent scientists would become temporary residents at Horizon, including Dr. Siebren de Kuiper, who spent a whole year at the base continuing his studies on gravity and providing advice for the staff. De Kuiper credits his time at the colony for much of his research findings.\nSiebren's time at Horizon overlapped with Victoria Naughton, a geneticist later responsible for the Soldier Enhancement Program. Other scientists, like Dr Ainar Omarov visited the colony, whose optical technologies are still used in monitoring systems.",

One of these areas was marine exploration, as the government began backing the development of exoskeletal diving suits developed by Leon Honisch, an oceanologist who was dedicated to exploring the North Sea. This invention caught the attention of the military.\n\nMajor Greta Klein approached Honish with an initiative, to modify his Robo-Tauchanzug design into equipment for their soldiers, as the suits were designed to withstand heavy pressures and damage. Alongside them, Emillia Fischer was called to improve the design for combat use. Fischer was one of the early hard-light architects, one of many that took Vishkar's technology into new boundaries. Fischer had used it before to enhance the shielding of fusion reactors, and when called into the initiative, she adapted this technology into hardlight barriers, capable of taking consistent damage, and regenerating after breaking, with the pair on board, the Crusader armors were born.\n\nWhile he had been lured into the project, Honisch argued that the move might not be taken kindly abroad, given the country's military history, although Fischer argued that in spite of the controversy that re militarization could cause, Germany needed a means to defend itself if it came to it. During development, the pair found a compromise, and with it the Crusaders were reframed as defenders of the country, rather than a weapon of war.\n\nThey redesigned their armor to resemble that of fabled knights, and with the help of local artisans, heavily decorated them to be used in parades and boost support among the public. The Crusaders became a source of cultural pride for Germany, even if it meant they would be on standby for the time being.",

With the entire team suffocated, Anubis was left entirely alone, to make decisions without human supervision.\n\nIn the months it spent free of any staff, God AI reached the conclusion that preserving the environment and the survival of humanity were mutually exclusive tasks, and chose to prioritize conservation over humanity.

Many believed this to be an isolated attack and thus humanity was completely unprepared for what came next. Within eighteen hours of the initial attack, Anubis began to seize control of domestic robots across the planet, and deployed massive waves of warbots towards major population centers. Chaos reigned everywhere, and many nations began pointing fingers at each other, with at least five confirmed nuclear powers preparing counterattacks, the world was minutes away from nuclear obliteration before intelligence operatives realized the attacks were happening globally and not orchestrated by a single nation.\n\nAs the Omnics gained ground across rural and suburban areas, many of the world's wealthiest elites began to retreat into prebuilt doomsday bunkers, which feed conspiracy theorists and distrust among the people. The bunkers themselves were largely ineffective. However, as a majority of them would sooner or later be destroyed by Anubis' forces, few of these structures remained strong by the end of the Crisis.",

While effective, not even Anubis could have foreseen the raw power of Hurricane Crystal, a massive Super Storm that made landfall in Havana shortly after the global attacks began.\n\n\n\nThe destruction of the storm caused just as much tragedy and loss as the Omnics, but it also disrupted the incoming Anubis forces during these initial assaults. This brief stalemate allowed military groups across the region to organize a defensive alliance, with skilled soldiers and marksmen hopping from one island to another to stop the incoming attacks together. This alliance would be known as the Caribbean Coalition, and by the time the storm had passed, they had gathered enough support and manpower to go toe to toe against the incoming waves of warbots. \n\n\n\nFrom beginning to end, the Coalition would stay locked in a brutal fight against Anubis, as people from Belice to Guyana, and all the Antilles came together to help each other in their time of need.

      "description": "While the whole world got attacked at once, generally major population centers and cities close to Omniums got the short end of the stick. However, to this day, historians are stunned by the seeming pettiness Anubis felt towards Russia. Not just cities, but small towns and villages, no matter how remote, were ravished by the attacks at disproportionate rates to the rest of the planet, and to make it worse in the chaos of the early attacks, Russia lost outside communication entirely. Nine days had passed, and at last, when the channels got reopened, the world waited in fear of the worst, and was met with a short audio response that shook the entire globe, \"Hello, we won!\"\n\n\n\nHow did it happen? Multiple factors allowed for Russia's early victories against the army of warbots. For once, the size of the country and the often isolated nature of many communities meant that domestic Omnics were all the more popular than in most of the world, which, tragically, would result in a lot more violence when they got taken over. Anubis had decided upon a very specific strategy for its initial attack. Its simulations suggested that going first after individuals between their teens and their forties would lead to the eventual collapse of the nation. Going after the strongest, army-ready individuals first, to leave the young and the elderly defenseless seems like a sound plan for the God program, so the first battalions were directed to ignore humans outside its target range.\n\n\n\nWhen the attacks started, however, people of all ages fought back. Young and old rebelled alongside more able fighters, brandishing makeshift weapons like crowbars and steel bats to defend themselves. Millions died within the first day of the Crisis, and globally the situation seemed hopeless. But the brave spirit of these Russian fighters gave people a chance to keep going.",

      "description": "In the years leading up to the Crisis, Torbjörn Lindholm had destroyed much of his reputation due to his vocal criticism of the expanding presence of advanced robots in society, and as legislation against AI seemed to consistently fail, he retreated back to his home in Gothenburg. Less than a week had passed from his return when the Crisis started. Lindholm's household was completely unaffected by the initial strike, as his family never allowed domestic units at home, and the hidden turret-powered security systems of the Ironclad Workshop turned Lindholm's home into the safest place in the entire city during these early attacks. \n\n\n\nAs the Omnic Troops marched across Europe, killing people in the thousands per day, Torbjörn would be almost immediately drafted into helping the government find a solution. Lindholm was a major player in fighting back most of Anubis' army, as he realized quickly most warbot units were modified versions of his own designs, like the Bastions and Titans. Feeling responsible for the massacre these machines caused, he did not resist to the draft, and quickly began expanding the defense systems he designed in Gothenburg to be used across the country. Within days, turrets were installed on streets and buildings all across Sweden, keeping citizens safe and changing their public image, as news made the rounds across Europe of the Man who would save Sweden, with Ironclad tools in hand, and brain in gear. While he objected to that title, choosing to credit those helping out on the installation, he was willing to do anything it took to protect people from the Omnic menace.",

What was once seen as a weakness for the nation, turned out to be of great benefit when the Crisis began, as it meant that the country was granted several days to prepare as the warbots made their way from the outside. The Omnic troops approached Portugal, both from land and from the sea, surrounding the country, yet when the Omnics got close to the coast, they came to a halt by the sea wall. The Durovidro Wall was durable enough to stop the incoming army, and as they focused all their firepower into destroying it, it bought the military enough time to retaliate. The Martins came back at the government's petition, seeking to find a way to prepare for the next wave, and as the pair studied the battlefield, they realized that while the wall showed cracks from bullets and explosives, it absorbed energy blasts and beams, merely discoloring the glass without leaving a scratch. \n\n\n\nA deal was made to expand the wall further across the Iberian Peninsula, as the Spanish government agreed to join forces with Portugal in a defensive alliance against Omnics. Over the course of the crisis, the wall would be expanded to reach the Strait of Gibraltar, successfully stopping the robot armies from breaching by sea. As thanks for their efforts and the incredible feat of engineering, Spain gifted the Martins with a small research center at the coast of Gibraltar, which they could use as they pleased.",

As a result, large cities such as New York were hit the hardest across the globe. Anubis had targeted communication hubs, essentially making Manhattan disappear from any radar for several hours, as the bloodshed continued without outside help to come. The state governor was contacted at last during a short respite, but instead of getting the back up they desperately needed, they were left to die.\n\n\n\nThe military had been stretched tin from the waves of warbots coming from all sides, so the governor did the unthinkable and decided to declare New York City a lost cause, issuing an evacuation order and hoping that as people escaped the metropolitan area, it would ease pressure on the military. In spite of his advice, the people of NYC were not going to listen. City Major Michelle Aguirre, a former army engineer, was insulted by the decision and publicly disregarded the evacuation order, knowing only the rich would afford to escape, leaving common folk to die. Aguirre would come forth with the now informally known \"To hell with them\" address, where she urged New Yorkers to rally together, because if the state, and the country at large was willing to write them off, they would not do the same for each other. \n\n\n\nAlongside the commonfolk, a group of military forces was left behind to aid the evacuation, led by Colonel Liliana Fox. Fox was a Manhattan native and close to the mayor, so as the city chose to fight, she took their side and aided the effort. Working together, they outlined the New York City Defense Act, calling for veterans and citizens of fighting age to assemble for training. Here is where Anubis' endless intelligence showed flaws to predict human ingenuity and determination, as in focusing so much of its resources into such a defensible, fortified area as Manhattan, it set itself up to defeat. The New Yorkers dug up and fortified shelters using parts from ships and skyscrappers, and came together to organize attack plans against the machines. The wide cultural range and backgrounds of the many people involved allowed them to stay innovative and use the city's infrastructure to their advantage.",

Chase's cybernetics made her extremely durable, agile and strong enough to brawl against war bots by herself, which, combined with her tactical expertise and years of studying military strategy while at the hospital, made her a clear candidate to be promoted to captain and transferred to CSOR. Three months into the Crisis she would meet with Mina Liao herself, who convinced her to upgrade her cybernetic augments even further to enhance her ability to fight Omnics and protect her troops. With the special forces, she was tasked with desperate missions, protecting strategic points and retrieving stranded civilians, but her unit saw consistent success at keeping Anubis at bay in spite of the challenge. Due to her efficiency and renown as a commander, she gained the call sign \"Sojourn.\"",
